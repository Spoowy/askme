Good - let's dig into what made him brilliant.

Korzybski's core insight was that humans get trapped by confusing the map (our words/concepts) with the territory (reality itself). But rather than just telling you his ideas, let's explore them.

Think of a time when you had a strong reaction to a word or label someone used - maybe they called something "stupid" or "impossible" or labeled you somehow.

What was happening in that moment between hearing the word and your reaction?
a semantic reaction
Erwin
Exactly! You caught that fast. So you're reacting to the word, not evaluating the actual situation.

Now here's where Korzybski gets really interesting - he said this happens constantly, not just in heated moments. We live in a world of semantic reactions.

Think about how you approach a "problem" versus an "opportunity" or "challenge." Same situation, different words.

What do you think Korzybski would say about why this word-swapping actually changes our capabilities?
I'm not sure.
Erwin
Fair enough - let me give you a breadcrumb to work with.

Korzybski noticed that when we use different words, our nervous system actually responds differently. The word "problem" might trigger stress responses, while "challenge" might activate curiosity circuits.

But here's his deeper insight: most people don't realize they're doing this. They think they're reacting to reality, but they're reacting to their verbal labels of reality.

So when someone says "I can't do math" - what are they really doing according to this view?
their words are a reaction from the nervous system towards being prompted of doing math, a short circuit, they don't think about the task at hand but their nervous system blocks even the consideration of the details of that.
